# Simple Spotify App

This project was originally started to learn about about Oauth for authenitication. So the plan was to build a simply script that would be able to grab whatever song I was currently listenting to in Spotify. Well that portion ended up turning into a full blown module to interact with Spotify. I am currently building this for fun, and will use it as a base to learn more about various development task.

CI/CD
Github ACtion
Test
etc...

As this is a hobby project, it should work for the examples and API's built, but just keep in mind that this will get changed quite often as I continue to want to tinker with new things. Below are a few of the endpoints we support, and also an example script how how you can authenticate and start using the API. You can also fork this project and update the REPO secrets and use the provided runner, to communicate directly with Spotify.
